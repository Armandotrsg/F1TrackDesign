# Re-design of Formula 1 Track Sections using Polynomial Equations

## Description

This repository contains a Matlab implementation for the re-design of 2 sections of 3 different Formula 1 tracks, using a third degree polynomial equation to connect 2 points in each track and predict 10 possible skid-points. The aim of this project is to safely place the crowd's benches in areas of the track that are less prone to accidents.

## Features

- Re-design of 2 sections of 3 different Formula 1 tracks.
- Use of third degree polynomial equations to connect 2 points in each track.
- Prediction of 10 possible skid-points in each track section.
- Implementation in Matlab.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Matlab installed on your system. You can then clone the repository and run the live script [Pista_De_Carreras(1).mlx](./Pista_De_Carreras(1).mlx)
